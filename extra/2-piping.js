/*
  PIPING FUNCTIONS
  ================
  1. Write 3 functions:
  - one that adds 2 numbers together
  - one that multiplies 2 numbers together
  - one that formats a number so it's returned as a string with a £ sign before it (e.g. 20 -> £20)

  2. Using the variable startingValue as input, perform the following operations using your functions all
  on one line (assign the result to the variable badCode):
  - add 10 to startingValue
  - multiply the result by 2
  - format it
  
  3. Write a more readable version of what you wrote in step 2 under the BETTER PRACTICE comment. Assign
  the final result to the variable goodCode
*/

function add(number1,number2) {
return number1+number2;
}

function multiply(number1,number2) {
return number1*number2
}

function format(number) {
 return `£ ${number}`;
}

const startingValue = 2;

// Why can this code be seen as bad practice? Comment your answer.
let badCode = startingValue + 10 *2; // its multiply 10 by 2 then add startingValue (the multiply priorety )

/* BETTER PRACTICE */

let goodCode = (startingValue + 10) *2
